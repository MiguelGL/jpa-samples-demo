# Demonstration Project for JPA and other Java DB Stuff

This is just a repository storing the code with samples of working technologies around Java and databases.

- JPA on Hibernate build, DDL generation, mapping samples and more (main target).
- Alternate samples using [jOOQ](http://www.jooq.org/).
- Sample [Liquibase](http://www.liquibase.org/) migration support.
- [QueryDSL](http://querydsl.com/) samples (and metamodel classes generation and usage).
- Extensive usage of [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org).
- JPA Metamodel classes generation.

If you find any of these or anything interesting in this project feel free to contact me.
